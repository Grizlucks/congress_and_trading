    "This project uses public data about the stock trades made by members of the US House of Representatives. This data is collected and maintained by Timothy Carambat as part of the [House Stock Watcher](https://housestockwatcher.com/) project. The project describes itself as follows:\n",

    "> With recent and ongoing investigations of incumbent congressional members being investigated for potentially violating the STOCK act. This website compiles this publicly available information in a format that is easier to digest then the original PDF source.\n",

    "> This site does not manipluate or censor any of the information from the original source. All data is transcribed by our community of contributors, which you can join for free by going to our transcription tool.

    "Some interesting questions to consider for this data set include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is there a difference in stock trading behavior between political parties? For example:\n",
    "    - does one party trade more often?\n",
    "    - does one party make larger trades?\n",
    "    - do the two parties invest in different stocks or sectors? For instance, do Democrats invest in Tesla more than Republicans?\n",
    "- What congresspeople have made the most trades?\n",
    "- What companies are most traded by congresspeople?\n",
    "- Is there evidence of insider trading? For example, Boeing stock dropped sharply in February 2020. Were there a suspiciously-high number of sales of Boeing before the drop?\n",
    "- When are stocks bought and sold? Is there a day of the week that is most common? Or a month of the year?"
