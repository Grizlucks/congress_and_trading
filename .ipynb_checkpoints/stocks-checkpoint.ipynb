    "- Is there a difference in stock trading behavior between political parties? For example:\n",
    "    - does one party trade more often?\n",
    "    - does one party make larger trades?\n",
    "    - do the two parties invest in different stocks or sectors? For instance, do Democrats invest in Tesla more than Republicans?\n",
    "- What congresspeople have made the most trades?\n",
    "- What companies are most traded by congresspeople?\n",
    "- Is there evidence of insider trading? For example, Boeing stock dropped sharply in February 2020. Were there a suspiciously-high number of sales of Boeing before the drop?\n",
    "- When are stocks bought and sold? Is there a day of the week that is most common? Or a month of the year?"
