    "- Is there a difference in stock trading behavior between political parties? For example:\n",
    "    - does one party trade more often?\n",
    "    - does one party make larger trades?\n",
    "    - do the two parties invest in different stocks or sectors? For instance, do Democrats invest in Tesla more than Republicans?\n",
    "- What congresspeople have made the most trades?\n",
    "- What companies are most traded by congresspeople?\n",
    "- Is there evidence of insider trading? For example, Boeing stock dropped sharply in February 2020. Were there a suspiciously-high number of sales of Boeing before the drop?\n",
    "- When are stocks bought and sold? Is there a day of the week that is most common? Or a month of the year?"

After seeing how little existed in terms of dates, and district codes as far as party allegiance was concerned, we decided to change tracks and opted for a more cohesive strategy. Essentially we will join the dataframes by creating a unique identifier column that will contain the last name and the district code for each member of congress. This works because each district will have only one representative, and it is highly unlikely for a district to have two representatives with the same last name in a row. In fact, we can ascertain this since we visited the webpage. So:"
